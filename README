If you're familiar with linux, that basically sums it up :-)

You need to copy the files in the right place.

Optionally add stuff to your start-stop sequence. On debian/ubuntu, use
update-rc.d:
    sudo update-rc.d eyefiserver defaults 98 02

et voilà.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
To use this script you need to have your Eye-Fi "upload key".
You can find it after configuring the card, which you can currently on do only
on Windows or Mac:

On Windows:
 See C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Eye-Fi\Settings.xml
On Mac:
 See ~/Applications Data/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml

You must search for it and paste it in eyefiserver.conf. Then server needs to be
reloaded after editing that file.
