If you're familiar with linux, that basically sums it up :-)

You need to copy the files in the right place.

Optionally add stuff to your start-stop sequence. On debian/ubuntu, use
update-rc.d:
    sudo update-rc.d eyefiserver defaults

et voil√†.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
To use this script you need to have your Eye-Fi "upload key".

on Windows or Mac:

You must search for it and paste it in eyefiserver.conf. Then server needs to be
